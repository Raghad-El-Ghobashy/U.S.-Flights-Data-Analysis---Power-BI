# U.S. Flights Data Analysis 🛫

### Project Overview
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of airline and airport operations for US flights in 2015, based on data sourced from Kaggle.
The project encompasses a full lifecycle of data handling from extraction through visualization, focusing on 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights records.


### Process Details :

1. **Data Extraction** 🔄:
   - Utilized a Python script to automatically extract data, ensuring the ability to refresh data for up-to-date analysis. The script manages extensive datasets involving flight operations.

2. **Data Transformation and Cleaning** ✨:
   - Applied rigorous cleaning processes to enhance data quality by addressing missing values and duplicates.
   - Transformed data for analysis suitability, adjusting timestamps, and categorizing reasons for cancellations.

3. **Data Loading** 📥:
   - Efficiently loaded the prepared data into an analytics database, facilitating comprehensive analysis.

4. **Data Modeling** 📊:
   - Created a star schema to facilitate effective querying and data aggregation necessary for the analysis.

5. **Data Analysis** 🔍:
   - Analyzed 5.82 million rows across 40 fields to determine flight volume variations, departure delay percentages and durations, causes of cancellations, and airline reliability.

6. **Reporting and Visualization** 📈:
   - Developed intuitive dashboards and visual representations, using bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to clearly illustrate trends and outliers in flight operations.


### Analysis :

1. **Flight Volume Variations**: Analysis of how overall flight volume varies by month and day of the week.
2. **Departure Delays**: Examination of what percentage of flights experienced a departure delay in 2015, including the average delay time in minutes.
3. **Seasonal Delay Patterns**: Insights into how the percentage of delayed flights varies throughout the year, with a specific focus on flights leaving from Boston (BOS).
4. **Flight Cancellations**: Metrics on how many flights were cancelled in 2015, including the percentage due to weather versus airline/carrier issues.
5. **Airline Reliability**: Evaluation of which airlines are the most and least reliable in terms of on-time departures.


### Key Insights 🌟

- **Airline Dashboard**: Offers a comparative analysis of airline operations, highlighting cancellations and delays.
- **Airport Dashboard**: Showcases performance metrics by airport, with a focus on operational challenges.
- **Delay Time Dashboard**: Provides a detailed view of delay metrics to identify operational inefficiencies across airlines.
